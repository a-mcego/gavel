# Gavel

## What is it?

Gavel is a free and open-source program for practicing foreign language through sentence training.

## Features

Gavel has *activities* that can be organized into *regimes*.
An activity is for example transcription.
A regime consists of activities that can be hierarchically organized, such that once a sentence is transcribed, it is available for the next activity.
Support is planned for whole texts, so once all the sentences for a text have gone through the regime the fulltext becomes available to the learner.

## Format

The sentence format is \*.mp3 and \.txt.
In the text file, the first line is the transcript and the second like is its translation and all notes that might be necessary.

For example
```
tennis.mp3
tennis.txt
  Mon fr√®re et moi sommes des bons joueurs de tennis.
  My brother and I are good tennis players.
```
